# What It To-Do
A to-do/ task list for work and everything else ðŸ“‹
 
 ## Description
 I've used a lot of to-do lists as a student, and at work. I'll be honest here - most out-of-the-box to-do lists just don't feel right. To-do/ task lists are very personal, and everyone likes having different features on their lists. Since I haven't found any products that tick all the boxes yet (pun intended), I thought I'd make one myself. 
 
 This is a personal project to create a tool that I'd enjoy using; learning how to code by diving right into building something is an added benefit ðŸ˜ƒ
 
 ## Tech Stuff
 I'll be using JavaScript for the behaviour of the tool, and HTML + CSS for the UI side of things - keeping it simple for now, and building on functionality whenever I'm hit with some inspiration. 
 
 One thing I need to figure out here is how to save/ cache the list of tasks so that they persist day-to-day. This should be fine locally, but we'll cross the prod-version bridge when we get to it.
 
 ## Ways of Working
 Since I'm doing this in my spare time, I think it's a good idea to track my tasks Kanban-style - I'll have a look at GitHub issues and the other tools on here for managing a project and go from there. Watch this space for more details as I go. 
 
 ## Credits/ References
 I'm not much of a developer (might've written 20 lines of code in my life up to this point ðŸ˜‚; since I'm working on this project and learning at the same time, I'll be needing a <b> LOT </b> of help. Google and Youtube will be my best friends here, as well as some good chats with developer mates of mine; I'll list any resources I get some inspiration from below: 
 
 ## Features
<b> Must-haves </b>
* Add a task
* Edit a task
* Delete a task
* Complete a task (with strike-through or other UX)
* Organise tasks by date
* Move tasks between dates

<b> Nice-to-haves </b>
* Pomodoro timer - a way to assign 25 min blocks to each task and use this as a deep-work/ productivity tracker
** Slack integration: automatically updating status and muting notifications if I'm in a deep-work session

 ## Design
 This one is right up there in importance - I want the tool to have a nice look and feel so that I can enjoy using it. 
 
 Once I build the general functionality, I'll uplift the UI - I want to research some design systems and see which one I like; another bridge for another day. 
 
 ## Roadmap/ Tasks
 *Wish I had a way of organising my tasks here* ðŸ˜‰
 
 1. Design the rough layout of the HTML page this tool will be displayed on
 2. Figure out the behaviour and user-interaction of the tool
 3. Get my Mr. Robot/ dev hat ðŸŽ© on and code out all the must-haves
 4. Test/ iterate/ debug/ test/ iterate and so on until I'm happy with the behaviour
 5. Uplift the design using a slick system/ framework 
 6. Decide where I want to go from here - build out some nice-to-haves etc.
 
 
 ## How-to
 TBD- testing, using this tool, etc. etc.
